# Tezos ERC-1155 smart contract specification

## Abstract

This document describe specification for ERC-1155 contract for Tezos adapted from the
corresponding contract specification for [Ethereum](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155).
Tokens standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 require a separate contract to be deployed for each
token type or collection. ERC-1155 contract manages multiple token types. A new token can be
created and configured without redeploying the contract.

## ERC-1155 overview

**Token type** is a specific token represented by its ID. **Owner** - Tezos address which can
hold tokens. **Operator** - Tezos address which initiates token transfer operation. **Operator**
must be approved to manage all tokens hold by the owner to make a transfer from the owner account.

Destination address for token transfer operation MAY implement `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface,
which MUST be called for transfer/mint transactions. Destination address may reject receiving
tokens by generation failure. This is considered a safety feature, ("safe transfer").

ERC-1155 support both single token transfer and atomic batch transfer of multiple tokens.

Administrative operations to create new token types, mint and burn tokens are not part of ERC-1155
specification.

## Difference between Ethereum and Tezos

Since Tezos and Michelson differ from Ethereum/Solidity, the following modification are made:

1. Tezos ERC-1155 does not emit events (a feature not supported by Tezos).
2. Tezos ERC-1155 does not implement ERC-165 `supportsInterface` entry point.
3. Ethereum specification says that if destination transfer address is not a smart contract (EOA),
then safety check is not performed. But if destination transfer address is a smart contract,
but it does not implement `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface, the transaction MUST fail.
It is not entirely clear what is Ethereum motivation here... Tezos does not have such
a distinction between Externally Owned Accounts and Contract Accounts (all Tezos accounts
since Babylon have smart contracts). This document uses the following interpretation of the
safety rule: implementation of `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface is optional for the transaction
destination contract. But if it is implemented, ERC-1155 implementation must call it.
4. Optional `ERC1155Metadata_URI` interface is not part of Tezos ERC-1155 specification.
