# Tezos ERC-1155 smart contract specification

## Abstract

This document describes specification for Tezos ERC-1155 contract adapted from the
corresponding specification for [Ethereum](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155).
Token standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 require a separate contract to be deployed for each
token type or collection. ERC-1155 contract manages multiple token types. A new token can be
created and configured without redeploying the contract. Both fungible and non-fungible tokens
can be stored in the same smart-contract.

## ERC-1155 overview

**Token type** is a specific token represented by its ID. **Owner** - Tezos address which can
hold tokens. **Operator** - Tezos address which initiates token transfer operation. **Operator**
must be approved to manage all tokens hold by the owner to make a transfer from the owner account.

Destination address for token transfer operation MUST implement `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface,
which MUST be called for transfer/mint transactions. Destination address may reject receiving
tokens by generating failure. This is considered a safety feature ("safe transfer").

ERC-1155 supports both single token transfer and atomic batch transfer of multiple tokens.

Administrative operations to create new token types, mint and burn tokens are not part of ERC-1155
specification.

## Difference between Ethereum and Tezos

Since Tezos and Michelson differ from Ethereum/Solidity, the following modifications are made:

1. Tezos ERC-1155 does not emit events (a feature not supported by Tezos).
2. Tezos ERC-1155 does not implement ERC-165 `supportsInterface` entry point.
3. Ethereum specification says that if destination transfer address is not a smart contract (EOA),
then safety check is not performed. It is not entirely clear what is Ethereum motivation here...
Tezos does not have such a distinction between Externally Owned Accounts and Contract Accounts (all
Tezos accounts since Babylon have smart contracts). Tezos specification requires that any destination
contract MUST implement `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface, so the standard supports safe-style transfers
only.
4. Optional `ERC1155Metadata_URI` interface is not part of Tezos ERC-1155 specification.
